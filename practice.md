# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

My project idea is to create an API that lists all the video games coming out for
the year

## Write between 3-5 user stories

- users will be able to look up a month
- users will be able to look up a genre of video game
- users will be able to look up a video game platform
- users will be able to get all the game's information and small description

## Plan your tables and columns

I will create a table for Video games then create columns for month, genre, platform,
and description

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs

I'll most likely use GameStop's API if it is available

## Wireframes

Will have wirefram done by Tuesday

## Timetable

I plan to begin creating the API Tuesday night. Then I will do as much as I can
over the long weekend, opening issues and getting help when I can.
